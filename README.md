**Task 1: Fibonacci Series Generator in Python**
This is a simple Python script that generates the Fibonacci series up to the number of terms you want. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous ones, starting from 0 and 1.

**How It Works:**
You input the number of terms you want.
The script then calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
